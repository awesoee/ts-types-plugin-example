# ***Hey, creator here.***

I recommend **not** using this plugin for the time being as it doesn't really do.... anything.

Your type definitons WILL work inside of Fraytools, but as of August 2024 there's no way to add functionality to them.

It may also interfere with the official API Types plugin, causing all type definitions to not appear.
